# AI-Big-Bang-Theory

The project had an initial idea of building a text prediction model like normal mobile keyboards. Then I fount out about GPT-2 and tried it instead of LSTM for the first time. I made this model with using '355M' and got the transcipts from https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com

The script is in the script folder and some interesting output and conversations are in the other folder. You can leave a comment of whatever you wanna try and I will get back to you ASAP ;) Cheers.
