# AI-Big-Bang-Theory

The project had an initial idea of building a text prediction model like normal mobile keyboards. Then I fount out about GPT-2 and tried it instead of LSTM for the first time. I made this model with using '355M' and got the transcipts from https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com

GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.

The script is in the script folder and some interesting output and conversations are in the other folder. You can leave a comment of whatever you wanna try and I will get back to you ASAP ðŸ˜‰.

<strong>Cheers.</strong>
