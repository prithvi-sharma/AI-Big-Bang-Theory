<h2> Leonard: Hey Sheldon, What do you think about String theory?</h2>

Sheldon: It is a very solid proposal and does, however, present a number of unique challenges which I cannot cope with.

Penny: What challenges?

Sheldon: The first challenge is copying itself. The physical laws are so sound and simple, how do we know that this idea was not just a ruse? The second challenge is convincing others that this idea was, in fact, a ruse?

Penny: Okay, great!!!!!

<h2> Penny: Sheldon, what would you give up? Science or Train?</h2>

Sheldon: Both.

Amy: Maybe I’m ready to move out.

Sheldon: No. It’s all I can do is give 100% and keep my options open.
